     <h3>Calculate Your Body Mass Index</h3>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 ">
     <p>Body Mass Index or BMI is a ratio of weight to the square of an individual&rsquo;s height.  It is often used to determine whether your weight is appropriate to your height.</p>
     <p>This is also a way to say objectively whether you are underweight, within a normal range, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese.  If you are under or overweight this tool also allows you to see by how much you are under or overweight.</p>

     <div style="font-size:0.9em;">
          <p>There are several inherent errors that are present when you calculate a BMI.   The main error involves the amount of muscle mass a person has.  People with greater muscle mass could be thought to have normal BMI&rsquo;s even when the number shows that they are overweight while people with lower muscle mass may be categorized as normal weight when in reality they are overweight. </p>
          
          <p>This difference is also seen when comparing BMI&rsquo;s with men and women.  Because men usually have greater muscle mass, a normal BMI for a man might be in the range of 22-26 while a normal BMI for a woman is lower and might be between 18.5 and 23.</p>
          
          <p>The rate at which we expect people to lose weight is determined by muscle mass.  The greater the muscle mass, the faster the weight loss.  The three main factors that play a role in muscle mass are age, sex, and weight.   Men who are younger and heavier will have greater muscle mass while women who are older and lighter will have less muscle mass.</p>
