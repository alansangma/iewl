	<p>If you are a Human Resources manager or a corporate executive who is looking to lower health care costs within your organization by reducing the chronic disease burden among your employees, then Inland Empire Weight Loss would like to help.  We offer a wellness program designed to reduce and improve obesity related chronic conditions through improvements in lifestyle, diet, and exercise.   We can work with an individualâ€™s current health care provider to design a program that improves overall health and reduces their medication burden. </p>
	<p> If your company offers a shared or full risk environment in providing health care benefits to your employees, then a wellness program such as ours will offer immediate benefits in reducing healthcare pharmacy, medical, and hospital claims.  Even if you are not in a shared/full risk environment, employees who are healthier have a decreased disease burden which results in a lowering of medical claims loss and a decrease in corporate health insurance rates.  Additionally, if your employees have a reduced weight and improvements in their health, there will be a decrease in absenteeism and an increase in productivity.</p>
