	<h3>How We Help You</h3>
	
      <p>Our clinic focuses on a multipoint program that addresses all aspects of weight loss.</p>
      <div class="row">
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Diet</h4>
			<p>We use a combination of education and medical grade meal replacements to facilitate weight loss.  Each assures an appropriate amount of protein for healthy weight loss and avoidance of hunger.  The education we provide helps you to keep your weight off forever.</p>
	      </div>
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Appetite Suppressants</h4>
	      <p>We provide appetite suppressants to most individuals.  Anorectic medications help you to avoid hunger and increases your metabolic rate to help in weight loss.</p>

      <div class="row">
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Medicine</h4>
	      <p>Many of our patients also have medical and psychological problems as well.  It is extremely important to optimize the medications that are used for these problems to assure they are not causing a gain or failure to lose weight.</p>
	      </div>
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Exercise</h4>
	      <p>There is no doubt that exercise helps in the weight loss process.  We encourage all of our patients to exercise regularly.  However, we regularly find people who are exercising in the wrong way to promote weight loss.  Often by making subtle changes to your exercise program, we can get you back on the right track to losing weight.</p>

	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Lipotropic Injections</h4>
	      <p>Many of our patients will notice a boost to their metabolism and an improvement in their weight loss with a weekly injection.  Each injection contains a blend of methionine, inositol, choline, vitamin B12, L-carnitine, and adenosine.  The combination can help to increase energy levels and encourage fat metabolism.  Ask how you can have this added to your regimen.</p>
	      </div>
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Support</h4>
	      <p>We find that regularly scheduled visits, usually at 2 week intervals, are important in keeping people on track towards their weight loss goal.  We have yet to meet someone who does not stray from the program at some point.  By having you come back regularly, we provide guidance and emotional support to solve problems that come up in many individuals program.</p>

	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Flexible Hours</h4>
	      <p>We realize that most of our patients work and scheduling is important for them.  Between our three providers, we have two mornings that start at 7:00 am. If you work locally, then we offer a lunch clinic. Additionally, our clinic has early evening hours until 6:00 pm 2 days per week so that you can come in on your way home.</p>
	      </div>
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Maintenance</h4>
	      <p>When you meet your goal, we tailor the program for you to taper off the frequency of your visits so that we know that you can make it on your own.</p>
	      </div>

      <div class="row">
	      <div class="col-md-6">
	      	<h4>Price</h4>
	      	<p>We usually accept PPO and Medicare insurance if you have health conditions related to your obesity.  To qualify, you generally need a BMI greater than 25 for PPO insurance or greater than 30 for Medicare with weight related health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, arthritis or other similar obesity related problems.  Please call for more details.</p>
			<p>If your insurance does not cover the visit, you will find our prices very reasonable. Many of our patients actually save money when we get them out of their junk and fast food habits. The long term savings are more important though as you will be healthier at a lower weight.  Consider it a long term investment in yourself.</p>
	      <ul>               
	           <li>Meals: $2</li>
	           <li>Visits: $50-$65</li>
	           <li>Intake: +$65</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>Continuing visits are charged on a sliding scale. Discounts are given when you purchase our products. The intake charge is added to the first visit due to the prolonged nature of the first visit. This will typically include a medical, diet, and exercise history, physical examination, EKG, program start instructions, and a prescription. Meals purchased through us usually assure more weight loss. Four meals per day are typical.</p>
