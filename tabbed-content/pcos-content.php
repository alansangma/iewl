	<p>PCOS or Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is actually a misnomer in that you do not need to have polycystic ovaries to have this diagnosis.  PCOS in susceptible individuals is actually one of the earliest manifestations of insulin resistance.  This can result in metabolic abnormalities that include an increase in insulin levels, an increase in testosterone levels that results in menstrual abnormalities and infertility in young women who are often not even categorized as obese by their physicians.  We will often find that weight loss through changes in diet and activity levels along with appropriate medications to improve insulin sensitivity can result in an increased rate of fertility and normalization of the menstrual cycle.
