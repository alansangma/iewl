			<p><strong>Getting kids to lose weight is very different</strong> than getting adults to lose weight.  First of all, obesity in kids is measured differently than it is in adults. Kids get insulin resistance and diabetes just like adults but the laboratory findings are different and they need to be assessed by a health care provider trained in this area.  We stress that there needs to be changes in the whole family when it comes to things such as eating and exercise.</p>

			<p>Childrenâ€™s relationship to foods is often still developing and strongly shaped by the environment that surrounds the child.  We help to properly assess your child in a sensitive way for problematic weight and weight related health programs and then we will propose a program that your child will be excited about participating in.  If you are worried that your child has a problem with their weight or if they have been told to lose weight by their pediatrician, then we are here to help.</p>
